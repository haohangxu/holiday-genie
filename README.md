# The Unofficial Holiday Genie

## About

The Unofficial Holiday Genie is an in-development skill for Amazon Alexa, built to explore the process of designing and building a skill. This skill allows users to query for fun and unusual, unofficial observances by asking Holiday Genie what to celebrate on a certain day.

## Technical Info

This skill is built with the Alexa Skills Kit and AWS Lambda using Python 2.7. 

## Future

This skill is currently being reviewed for publication. The number of holidays that Holiday Genie knows is limited, and mostly serves as a proof of concept and provides the structural foundation for expanding into a more fun skill. Future work could include increasing the number of unofficial observances Holiday Genie knows, expanding Holiday Genie's knowledge of observances geographically, and providing new ways for users to interact with Holiday Genie.
